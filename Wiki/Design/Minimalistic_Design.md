# Minimalistic design
Minimalistic design is a popular design approach that is characterized by its simplicity, clarity, and use of negative space. When it comes to web design, minimalism is a design style that emphasizes the use of a limited color palette, a small number of simple design elements, and typography. The goal of minimalistic web design is to create a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate website that provides the user with a clean and uncluttered experience.

One of the key features of minimalistic web design is the use of negative space or white space. Negative space refers to the space surrounding design elements, and it is used to create balance, contrast, and visual hierarchy. The use of negative space provides a sense of clarity and focus, which is essential in helping users to quickly and easily find the information they are looking for.

Another key characteristic of minimalistic web design is the use of simple and clear typography. Typography plays a crucial role in minimalistic web design since it is used to convey information and create a hierarchy of content. Minimalistic typography is typically characterized by the use of sans-serif fonts, which are clean and easy to read. The font size should be large enough to be read easily on different screen sizes, and the spacing between lines of text should be sufficient to improve readability.

Minimalism has its origins in the art world in the 1960s, and it has since been adopted by many different fields, including web design. Minimalistic web design has been used for over a decade and has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the growth of mobile devices and the need for quick, easy-to-use interfaces. In essence, minimalistic web design is all about creating a clean, uncluttered, and user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and understand.

## Minimalism and sustainable web design
Minimalism and sustainable web design go hand in hand. When you have a minimalistic design you tend to have fewer elements and distractions on your web page, and fewer elements often means a lighter web page. In sustainable web design you try to make web pages as light as possible, and in combinations with being light you try to remove distractions and only show information that is relevant.
